      <description>This is a combination of a couple of recipies for tying Pheasant Tail Nymphs.
To allow it to sink effectively, I added a bead and some wraps of lead wire from these steps. I also created a tapered body like in these instructions.
For most of the rest, I followed the simpler structure from the following video. The main highlights:
 Before moving the wraps all the way back to the bend I place a piece of copper wire for the back to secure it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of home automation and have run Home Assistant for some time to streamline automating lights and AV controls. Until recently I ran it on a small Raspberry Pi 3, but as I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to add more integrations and automations I found I needed more horsepower. This is especially true as I&amp;rsquo;ve added additional services around HA like Prometheus and Grafana to better monitor the servers and sensors around the house.</description>
